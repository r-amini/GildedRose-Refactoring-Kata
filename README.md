# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata
In this exercise, I created some test cases to cover all constraints. Then, I refactored the UpdateQuality function, and I devided into some functions. Then, I implemented Factory design pattern, and finally, I added "Conjured" to the application.

# How to use it
You can just fetch the main branch, and run it by Visual Studio.

# Note

I tried to do this exercise with the least changes to external files like Program.cs. It means, I tried not to change too much files.
