# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata
In this exercise, I created some test cases to cover all the constraints before refactoring. Then, I refactored the UpdateQuality function, and I devided into some subfunctions. Then, I implemented Factory and Stategy pattern, and finally, I added "Conjured" item to the system.

# How to use it
You just need to fetch the main branch (master), compile, test and run it by Visual Studio.

# Note
I tried to do this exercise with the least changes to the external files (like Program.cs). It means, I tried not to change too many files.

# Test
For testing porpuse, I used approval test since I wanted to test a combination of inputs to cover everything in UpdateQuality function.
