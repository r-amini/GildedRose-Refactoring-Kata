# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata
In this exercise, I created some test cases to cover all the constraints. Then, I refactored the UpdateQuality function, and I devided into some subfunctions. Then, I implemented Factory design and stategy pattern, and finally, I added "Conjured" to the application.

# How to use it
You can just fetch the main branch (master), compile, test and run it by Visual Studio.

# Note
I tried to do this exercise with the least changes to the external files like Program.cs. It means, I tried not to change too many files.

# Test
For testing porpuse, I used approval test since I wanted to test a combination of inputs.
